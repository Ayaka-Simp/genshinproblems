            (another) WARNING: Pretty long essay, some jargon and technical
            language but this is the worst issue so I think it&apos;s deserved.
            HoYoverse&apos;s greed is unforgivable, so I&apos;m sorry if I start
            ranting too much here.
          </h2>
          <p className="animate bottom" style={{ animationDelay: "5.7s" }}>
            Oh, my god. I don&apos;t know where to start this one, so I guess
            I&apos;ll start from the beginning. A game&apos;s anniversary is
            usually a time of joyous celebration, with many rewards and fun
            events. This is especially the case with gacha games (for example:
            Cookie Run Kingdom&apos;s anniversary rewards were huge), because
            usually the currency (primogems for Genshin) is really hard to get,
            so they will give many on the anniversary.
            <br />
            <br />
            For the events in Genshin/on the web, we only got 1,700 primogems,
            80,000 mora (common currency in Genshin), 18 Mystic Enhancement Ore
            (used to level up weapons), and 8 Hero&apos;s Wit (used to level up
            characters). The rest of the rewards are for contests, for example
            the fan art contest which gives 10,000 primogems and a 10.2 inch
            iPad to 5 people, a word puzzle which gives 100 primogems to 1,000
            people, a profile creating thing where there is a 10% chance to win
            a &quot;Blessing of the Welkin Moon&quot; (300 primogems at the
            start and 2700 primogems over 30 days), but the rest of people would
            get 100,000 mora (which isn&apos;t actually a lot), and a cosplay
            contest where 5 people would win 6,000 primogems and a pair of
            AirPods.
            <br />
            <br />
            Many people might think that those are still a lot and we should be
            grateful. But only extremely talented people can complete some of
            those competitions (for example, the fan art) and (especially the
            cosplay) cost more than you win (Genshin cosplays would cost
            hundreds or even thousands of dollars only to win 160 dollars worth
            of primogems and AirPods).
            <br />
            <br />
            (I&apos;m just using Cookie Run Kingdom as an example here, but this
            paragraph applies to lots of gacha games, even Honkai Impact 3
            <sup>rd</sup> which is another of HoYoverse&apos;s games.) In Cookie
            Run Kingdom, players got 100 gacha pulls (they&apos;re not called
            wishes in CRK), plus a bunch of other stuff in the game that I
            can&apos;t list because there are too many. This is actually very
            generous (compared to Genshin) but not so generous that it
            completely ruins the game because everyone has everything.
            <br />
            <br />
            That brings us to the image in the top. Many people were spamming
            :qiqifallen: in Genshin Impact&apos;s Discord server, and it got so
            bad that the mods put a slow-mode of 30 minutes in their Discord
            chat, and started banning anyone hating for the anniversary rewards.
            This miscommunication and censorship is even worse than China&apos;s
            internet censorship. Speaking of spamming, may people were spamming
            1-star reviews on Genshin. This eventually spread to other games,
            like Honkai Impact 3<sup>rd</sup> and Tears of Themis
            (HoYoverse&apos;s other games). After a while, things got out of
            hand with people review bombing completely unrelated games such as
            Mobile Legends Bang Bang, and five people even 1-starred Google
            Classroom!
            <br />
            <br />
            To be completely honest, I&apos;m not really sure what else to say
            here because so many other people have covered it. All that I want
            to say is that HoYoverse is greedy and will sacrifice player
            experience/fun just for more advertising. This is a good strategy to
            lure new players in, but not for keeping everyone who joined inside
            the player base forever.
